# Tank Base
A Touch and Move game where you have to cross the mines to the end. Solo Dev game published on Play Store.

## Goal
The primary goal for me in this project was  - 
1. Implement Design Patterns and OOPS
2. Implement Raycast for touch point and wall break
3. Implement Nav Mesh Agent for Tank Movement
4. Implement Particle effects for tank blast effect

Looking at the folder structure you can see the order in which I have arranged scripts. The whole idea was make codebase modular and easy to use.

## Architecture
For this game, I implemented 4 Design Patterns
1. MVC (Model-View-Controller)
2. Singleton
3. Service Locator (Game Service)
4. Observer Pattern

Along with that I segregated code on their use case following the OOPS concepts.


## Conclusion
This was a extensive learning project, where I got to implement 4 design pattern simultaneously and learn and how to manage code base and establish script communication.
